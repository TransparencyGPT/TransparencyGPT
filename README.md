Sprint 1 Updates

Lucy Zimmerman: 

During the first sprint, my focus was on conducting extensive research using ChatGPT. I invested significant time in prompting GPT with various URLs and exploring questions such as "detect any biased language" and "what is some helpful context for an informed reader on this news outlet." However, I encountered a challenge where some URLs were resistant to AI scraping. To address this, I created a Python program capable of retrieving web pages, converting them into PDFs, and extracting vital information like the author's name and main text. This development significantly enhanced our data acquisition process. I also began setting up an initial prompt with the OpenAI API to integrate these downloaded PDFs into our workflow. This setup was only partially completed due to the pending acquisition of API keys. Meanwhile, our team convened to discuss the potential of using Claude for more effective analysis of the articles themselves.

Looking ahead to the next sprint, my primary goal is to define the specific information and prompts that will be used with Claude to elicit the desired responses. Additionally, I aim to integrate our various Python programs, creating a cohesive system that combines data retrieval, contextual analysis using OpenAI, and bias detection through Claude. Another key objective is to contribute to the development of the user interface for this program. I plan to focus on seamlessly integrating the front-end and back-end components to ensure a functional and user-friendly experience. This comprehensive approach will not only streamline our processes but also enhance the overall efficacy of our project.
