Nicolas Friley:

This class provided an exceptional opportunity to concentrate on a single project and delve deeply into its implementation. It felt similar to a startup weekend event spanning the entire quarter, and the realization that we possessed the skills to independently develop all the necessary elements for a functional prototype leveraging LLMs was really gratifying.

The most valuable lesson I learned was the importance of having enthusiastic teammates with complementary skills. This enables each team member to focus on specific aspects, such as front-end or back-end development, while still possessing enough overlapping skills to support and assist one another. This whole process introduced to me the integration of different languages and APIs, and ways to collaborate on writing code efficiently as a group.

The guest lectures provided interesting insights into the growing demand for startups that leverage or develop LLMs and LLM development tools. They also offered various approaches for entering this market, highlighting its potential and significance.
