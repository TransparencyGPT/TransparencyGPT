This class, for me, was an incredible journey of discovery and hands-on learning, set within a startup-like environment that I thoroughly enjoyed. It pushed me out of my comfort zone and into a realm where practical application was the primary mode of learning. Witnessing the evolution of our project from a mere idea in the first week to a fully developed application by the end of the quarter was immensely rewarding. One of the most significant lessons I learned was about the importance of project structure—specifically, the value of dividing a project into multiple files for efficiency and collaboration. This approach enabled me to really push my UI development skills to the maximum, really keeping a cohesive design and developing those skills.

Collaborating with my team was another highlight of this experience. The power of teamwork became evident as we decomposed the project into smaller, more manageable parts, allowing us to reuse code across different applications and integrate new features with ease. This collaborative spirit extended to our engagement with various technologies and tools throughout the course. The guest lectures were particularly enlightening, exposing us to the vast landscape of Language Learning Models (LLMs) and the myriad of techniques and technologies within this space. From these sessions, I gleaned that there isn't a one-size-fits-all LLM for every task. This realization underscored the importance of staying informed about the latest advancements in the field and being open to experimenting with different technologies to find the best fit for our project's needs.

For example, our initial use of Claude for text analysis, while effective, proved too slow for our requirements. This led us to switch to GPT, which significantly improved the efficiency of our application. Such experiences taught me the value of flexibility and adaptability in technology projects, particularly when working with cutting-edge tools like LLMs.

Reflecting on the class, I can confidently say that the blend of theoretical learning and practical application, the opportunity to work closely with a dedicated team, and the exposure to a wide range of technologies made this one of my most memorable and valuable educational experiences. It was not just about building an app but about the journey we took to get there, learning, experimenting, and growing together.

I enjoyed the startup-like environment of this class, and I really feel like I learned a lot with the “hands-on” approach for this class. What I really enjoyed about this class was seeing the development of a project, from the idea stage back in week one to its full development at the end of the quarter. Something that I learned about from this class is the significance of dividing a project into multiple files and the power of teamwork. At the beginning of the quarter, we were working on the same files in react native. It was hard to keep track of exactly what lines each of them were modifying. In addition, as the complexity of the project grew, it was very difficult to keep track of everything in just a few files. The decomposition of the project into multiple files allowed us to reuse some of the code across different applications, it allowed for better and much more efficient collaboration within our group, and it allowed us to integrate new features into the application much more easily. It was an amazing experience to collaborate with such a great group, eager to constantly improve the app.

Another lesson that the class taught me is that it’s okay to experiment with different technologies. What I especially enjoyed from the guest lecturers was the exposure to many different technologies and techniques that exist in regard to LLM, from the significance of pre-training to different models and different programs. A takeaway I got from these lectures is that there might not currently be a single “best” LLM for every single task, which is why it’s very important to learn about all of the different advancements that are happening in the field. I learned that it’s important to stay up to date with everything that is happening and to know the various options individuals have both to utilize in projects or to expand this technology ourselves. In addition, it can be very useful to experiment with several of these technologies. As an example, when we utilized Claude at first, we noticed that it was too slow. We then utilized GPT, and we noticed that it was a lot more efficient for our use cases. Thank you CS224G!

This class provided an exceptional opportunity to concentrate on a single project and delve deeply into its implementation. It felt similar to a startup weekend event spanning the entire quarter, and the realization that we possessed the skills to independently develop all the necessary elements for a functional prototype leveraging LLMs was really gratifying.

The most valuable lesson I learned was the importance of having enthusiastic teammates with complementary skills. This enables each team member to focus on specific aspects, such as front-end or back-end development, while still possessing enough overlapping skills to support and assist one another. This whole process introduced to me the integration of different languages and APIs, and ways to collaborate on writing code efficiently as a group.

The guest lectures provided interesting insights into the growing demand for startups that leverage or develop LLMs and LLM development tools. They also offered various approaches for entering this market, highlighting its potential and significance.
